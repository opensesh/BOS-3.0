Industry reporting notes that more than half of B2B marketers already use AI for creative assets, and that integrations like Figma’s could further shift early‑stage visual work from specialists to generalists across product and marketing teams. At the same time, Adobe’s decision to bring Photoshop‑class tools into ChatGPT the day before Figma’s announcement underscores how all three major players—Adobe, Canva, and Figma—are vying to own the prompt‑to‑presentation workflow. Observers say the real battleground will be how seamlessly these tools plug into ChatGPT’s app directory and how well they address enterprise demands around security, compliance, and consistent brand output.",

OpenAI has cast ChatGPT as a kind of “operating system for apps,” and Figma’s integration fits that vision by turning conversational context into editable design artifacts that live across Slides, Buzz, and FigJam. Future updates are expected to deepen this connection, potentially tying Figma’s AI editing and template systems more tightly to ChatGPT so non‑designers can generate on‑brand materials with minimal hand‑offs. For now, the expansion of the Figma app in ChatGPT marks a tipping point in everyday workflows: ideas that once sat in documents or chat logs can increasingly skip straight to structured diagrams and slide decks, ready for teams to refine together.",
