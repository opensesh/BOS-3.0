In the new Slack integration, those capabilities are wired directly into chat: the assistant reads recent messages in a thread, infers the task, locates the relevant repository, and begins a coding session tied to that conversation. As it works, Claude Code posts incremental status updates back into Slack — for example, confirming it has reproduced a bug, generated a fix, or added tests — and then shares a link to a ready-to-review pull request once the workflow completes. Anthropic stresses that the tool respects existing coding standards and never modifies code without human approval, aiming to fit into current review practices rather than bypass them.",

With Claude Code embedded in Slack, a typical incident can now begin and end in the same channel: a teammate reports a problem, someone tags @Claude, and the AI handles diagnosis, patching, and pull request creation while narrating each step in the thread. Commentators argue this makes Slack the “source of truth” not only for decisions and discussions, but also for the execution trail of automated fixes and improvements. Startup-focused coverage further highlights that by lowering the overhead of spinning up structured work from informal chat, smaller teams may be able to ship features and address bugs faster without heavy process tooling.",
