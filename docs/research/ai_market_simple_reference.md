## UNIT ECONOMICS & PRICING COMPARISON

### Price per Customer (Annual)

```
ChatGPT:
- Consumer: $20/month = $240/year
- Enterprise: Varies, but average ~$130/user/year across deployed orgs

Cursor (AI IDE):
- Free tier: Limited tokens
- Pro: $20/month = $240/year (but token-based, users spend more)
- Enterprise: Custom pricing
- Actual average: $500-1,200/user/year (5-8x ChatGPT premium)

Lovable (Web App Builder):
- Freemium: Limited
- Pro: $20-99/month = $240-1,188/year
- Enterprise: Custom pricing
- Actual average: $1,000-5,000/customer/year

Your Brand OS Target:
- Pro: $500-1,500/month = $6,000-18,000/year
- Enterprise: $1,500-3,000/month = $18,000-36,000/year
- Actual average target: $1,000-2,000/customer/month = $12,000-24,000/year

Justification for premium pricing:
✓ 5-8x more valuable than horizontal tools (vertical specialization)
✓ Saves entire creative team labor (30-40% time savings demonstrated)
✓ Reduces rework by eliminating off-brand outputs
✓ Defensible due to proprietary brand data
```

2024: 85-131% (base of $2.3B)
2025: 224% (base of $3.7B)
2026: 92% projected (base of $12B)
2027: 70% projected (base of $23B)
Trend: SLOWING (normal as base grows)

Anthropic growth rate trend:
2023: 470%
2024: 1,889%
2025: 488% (base of $850M)
Trend: ACCELERATING (aggressive catch-up)

```

### Market Insight

```
Foundation models: Growing 40% CAGR (slowing down)
Application layer: Growing 72% CAGR (speeding up)
= Value shifting upward in stack

This is the same pattern seen in:
- Cloud computing (AWS became more valuable than chip makers)
- Search (Google became more valuable than infrastructure)
- Social (Meta became more valuable than cable/ISPs)

Application-layer specialists with proprietary data win in mature software markets.
```

## VERTICAL AI: The Winning Pattern

### Why Vertical Apps Beat Horizontal Platforms

```
Horizontal Platform (ChatGPT):
- Good at everything
- Great at nothing
- Pricing: $130/user/year
- Competition: Infinite (every other AI platform)
- Defensibility: None (switching costs = zero)

Vertical Specialist (Cursor, Lovable, Your Brand OS):
- Specialized for specific domain
- Exceptional at solving specific problem
- Pricing: $500-2,000/customer/year (5-8x premium)
- Competition: Only 1-2 other vertical specialists
- Defensibility: High (domain data moat, workflow embedding)

Historical precedent: Figma (specialized design) beat Adobe (horizontal creative suite) in speed to $1B
```

### Vertical AI Companies Emerging in 2025-2026

```
Coding: Cursor ($29B), GitHub Copilot ($4-5B est)
Web Apps: Lovable ($6.6B), Bolt ($2-3B est)
Design: [Emerging 2026]
Legal: [Established 2025]
Healthcare: [Established 2025]

- Based on company disclosures
- Funding announcements confirm ARR
- Valuation rounds provide data points

2025 H1 Data: HIGH (85-90%)
- Actual reported metrics through June
- Company statements through August

2025 H2 Data: MEDIUM (70-80%)
- Company guidance and targets
- Some actual data through December
- Some projection/extrapolation

2026+ Data: MEDIUM (60-75%)
- Analyst projections

- Variance increases with each year

Segment allocation (Foundation vs App vs Enterprise): MEDIUM (70%)
- Estimated based on company behavior
- Not perfectly reported by vendors
- Trend direction is clear; exact numbers estimated
```

### Key Assumptions Built Into Projections

```
1. Foundation model pricing stabilizes 2026-2028
   (competition drives 20-30% price drops)

2. Application layer achieves higher adoption
   (vertical specialization premium justified)

3. No major regulation restricts AI
   (EU AI Act applies constraints but doesn't ban)

4. OpenAI and Anthropic go public 2026-2027
   (validates market, unlocks institutional capital)

5. 20-40 vertical AI companies reach $1B+ ARR by 2028
   (currently only 3-4; proliferation expected)

6. Enterprise AI deployment accelerates
   (50%+ annual growth 2025-2028)

If any assumption breaks, adjust market size accordingly.
Most likely upside: AI adoption faster than predicted
Most likely downside: Regulation creates friction
