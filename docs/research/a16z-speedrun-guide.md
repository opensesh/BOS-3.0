## The Selection Hierarchy (Explicit Priority)

### #1: TRACTION (Most Important)[16]
**"Traction is number one, two, and three. Then team. Then TAM."**

#### Traction Quality Ranking (Best to Acceptable):
1. **Long-term recurring revenue** with significant companies[1]
2. **Short-term revenue contracts** (monthly subscriptions, pilots)[1]
3. **Design partners** actively using rough product[1]
4. **Waitlist/early validation** with payment intent or viral traction[16][54]

#### Quantitative Benchmarks:
- **D30 Retention**: 60% = "iconic, legendary"; >80% = likely measurement error[28][16]
- **Users**: Few hundred-thousand is acceptable for apps/tools[5]
- **Interview validation**: 150+ customer conversations showing repetitive patterns[9]
- **B2B proof**: Design partners across top 3 customer KPIs[9]

#### Red Flags:
- "I don't have traction because I'm still in stealth" → Not accepted[1]
- Over-inflated metrics (claiming >80% retention, PMF with 100 users)[16]

---

### #2: TEAM (Second Priority)[16]
**Deep collaboration history + complementary skills + founder chemistry**

#### What Investors Assess:
- **Cofounder relationship depth**: Worked together before, college roommates, coded together[1]
  - Avoid: Recently met cofounders without reps together[1]
  - Note: Solo founders accepted; ~30% of SR005 had previously been rejected[35]
  
- **Complementary skills**: Technical + creative + strategic[3][14]
  - B2B requires: Someone comfortable cold-calling, closing enterprise deals[1]
  - Key phrase from investors: "Clear counterparts solving each other's gaps"[1]

- **Decision-making transparency**: How do you handle disagreements? Who decides what?[1]
  - Avoid: Awkward silences when asked hard decisions[1]

- **Student of company building**: Not just product obsession[1]
  - Red flag: "We'll build the team later" or "We can do engineering ourselves"[1]

- **Ability to self-advocate**: "Can you brag about yourself in a way that builds conviction you're the one to unlock this?"[1]

---

### #3: TAM (Lowest Priority)[1]
- **Don't inflate**: Claiming every human on Earth is your TAM is transparent[1]
- **Focus initial wedge**: Pick narrow wedge achievable in 1-3 months, then expand[26]
- **Deck allocation**: ~50% initial wedge, ~50% long-term vision[26]

---

## Earned Secrets: The Hidden Differentiator[1][26][40]

**Definition**: Non-obvious insights from lived experience that create unfair advantage

### Examples:
- Built internal FAANG tool that 10x'd productivity, no one outside team knows[26]
- Traveled abroad, saw young users remixing AI video in patterns unseen in US[26]
- Industry insider knowing exactly why incumbents will fail[1]
- Outsider who did the work to become subject matter expert[1]

### Validation: Industry Mapping
- Meet 20-30+ stakeholders: customers, advisors, competitors, adjacent founders[1]
- Understand market history: What was tried? Why failed? Why incumbents succeeded?[1]
- Evidence: "I talked to all major players in my space"[1]

### Insider vs. Outsider:
- **Insiders**: Domain expertise + relationships BUT risk "knowing everything" without validation[1]
- **Outsiders**: Unconstrained by convention BUT must do the work to become expert[1]

---

## Velocity: Speed as Competitive Advantage[16]

"Velocity is everything in the AI era"[16]

- Ship product quickly and iterate faster[3]
- Public building: sizzle reels, demos, updates generating organic waitlist[16][54]
- Customer interview velocity: 150+ conversations in compressed time[9]
- Hardware validation: Pre-orders/purchase commitments (e.g., Taya necklace: 1 sold every 4 minutes)[54]
- Don't wait for permission[2][3]

---

## Application Best Practices

### Deck Structure
- **Length**: 7-15 slides maximum (some prefer 6-7)[1]
- **Font**: Large and readable[1]
- **Brevity = clarity**: Problem in 1 slide, not 5[1]
- **Lead with strength**: Traction/design partners front and center[1]
- **Demos over decks**: Show the product working[3][14]

### Communication Framework: SCQA[1][60]
**Situation** → **Complication** → **Question** → **Answer**
- **Lead with your answer**: State your solution/insight in opening 3 sentences[1]
- Investors review 100+ applications; bury the lead = rejected[1]

### Competitive Analysis
- **Don't**: Feature comparison matrix with green checkmarks[1]
- **Do**: "Here's why every competitor will hit a brick wall and we won't"[1]
- Must show: Market history, structural limitations of competitors, your unique angle[1]

### Interview (10-minute movie trailer)[1]
- Master the 1-sentence company description[1]
- Two killer numbers: momentum (growth) + unit economics (CAC/LTV)[39]
- Anticipate objections: Great founders answer questions before asked[1][39]
- Don't waste time: Skip introductions of 6 team members and advisors[1]
- Emphasize differentiation explicitly for crowded categories[1]

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Content Errors
- Not talking about team enough / why you're the right people[1]
- Too much product demo without explaining why it matters[1]
- Over-inflating metrics (80% retention, PMF claims with 100 users)[16]
- Vague on differentiation in crowded categories[1]
- Red-flag claims: "No competitors," "We'll go viral," evasiveness on failure[30]

### Process Errors
- **Typos**: Signals carelessness in detail-oriented work[1]
- **Outdated/missing LinkedIn**: Shows lack of professionalism[1]
- **Omitting outlier achievements**: YouTube channels, side projects, creative work matter[1]
- **Over-productizing customer calls**: Lead with listening, not pitching[1]

### Interview Pitfalls
- Rambling instead of concise[1]
- Not showing competitive understanding[1]
- Unprepared for obvious questions[1]
- Weak on founder decision-making or roles[1]

---

## Signals of Exceptionality[1]

"Founders are outliers—we want evidence you've done outlier things"[1]

Include:
- YouTube channel with 10K+ subscribers[1]
- Weird projects built for personal interest[1]
- Open-source contributions[1]
- Creative work, competitive achievements[1]
- Strong writing/insights on LinkedIn/Twitter[1]
- **Don't omit**: Personal projects are evidence of agency[1]

---

## Reapplication Strategy[35]

~30% of SR005 had previously been rejected. Reapply if:
- **Traction improved**: More users, revenue growth, better retention[35]
- **Team strengthened**: Added complementary cofounder[1]
- **Insight refined**: Evolved thinking based on customer learning[35]
- **Online presence updated**: Recent accomplishments visible[1]

**Timeline**: 5-6 months between cohorts = reasonable time to build validation[35]

---

## Post-Acceptance: Program Value & Demo Day

### Beyond the $1M:
- **$5M+ in credits** (often covers full MVP development)[66]
- **1:1 mentorship** from a16z partners (Andrew Chen, Josh Lu, domain experts)[41]
- **Recruiting support** + vetted talent network[41]
- **Go-to-market + brand strategy** from content team[20]
- **Access to 500+ a16z-backed founders** for peer learning[41]
- **Visa assistance** for international founders[2][41]

### Demo Day (Week 12):
- 2-minute pitch to 500-1,000+ investors[4][17]
- Founders rehearse extensively (some practice in VR)[17]
- Post-Demo Day: 45+ investor meetings in 72 hours possible[17]
- **Traction by Demo Day** = 6x more likely to raise Series A[38]

### Portfolio Performance:
- **SR002**: 80%+ secured follow-on funding[32][61]
- **Credits efficiency**: Often covers all cloud/software costs[66]
- **Median capital deployment**: $500K on hiring + GTM[66]

## Quick Reference: Investment Partner Insights[1]

| Partner | Key Perspective |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Josh Lu** (GM) | Traction > team > TAM. Demo over deck. Founders bragging = critical. |
| **Marcus Segal** | Velocity ≠ traction. Three signals matter. Non-obvious ideas > tar pits. |
| **Sam Shank** | Communication effectiveness = #1 priority. Founders articulate vision compellingly. |
| **Kenan Saleh** | Deep validation > traction size. Know history & competitive limitations. |
| **Emily Bennett** | Cofounder depth matters. Listen actively in customer calls, don't pitch. |
| **Troy Kirwin** | Technical founders = students of company building, not just product. Velocity wins. |
| **Fareed Mosavat** | Ideas matter. Outsider founders must do the work to become experts. |
| **Jon Lai** | Pick a wedge, nail it, expand. Pivots fine—show learning velocity. |

## Competitive Context: Speedrun vs. YC

| Factor | Speedrun | YC |
|--------|----------|-----|
| **Acceptance** | <0.5% | ~1% |
| **Investment** | $500K for 10% + $500K pro-rata | $500K for ~7% |
| **Credits** | $5M+ (AI, cloud partners) | Lesser focus |
| **Duration** | 12 weeks (1 day/week in-person) | Varies |
| **Focus** | Gaming, AI, XR, prosumer tools | Broad |
| **Demo Day Scale** | 500-1,000+ investors | 300-500+ investors |

---

## Three Key Takeaways

1. **Traction first**: Revenue, design partners, or validated demand (50+ customer interviews) is essential. Idea quality matters less than market validation.[1][16]

2. **Team + earned secret**: Complementary cofounders with proven collaboration + unique insight from lived experience beats pedigree or polished pitch.[1][26]

3. **Build before applying**: Best applications emerge from companies already demonstrating velocity. Speedrun funds momentum, not potential.[1]
