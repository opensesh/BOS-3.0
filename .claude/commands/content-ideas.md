# OPEN SESSION - Content Ideas Command

> **Purpose:** Collaborative content creation workflow for all platforms  
> **Last Updated:** October 2025

---

## `/content-ideas`

**Purpose:** Work with Karim to generate, refine, and structure content ideas for any platform - from initial concepts to finished scripts, captions, and posts.

**Philosophy:** This is a **collaborative dialogue**, not a one-shot command. Claude asks questions, listens to feedback, and iterates until the content is right.

---

## How It Works

### Step 1: Initiate
**Karim types:** `/content-ideas`

### Step 2: Discovery (Claude Asks)
Claude needs to understand:

**Primary Question:**
> "What channel(s) are we creating for?"
> - Instagram (Reels, Carousel, Single post, Stories?)
> - YouTube (Short or long-form?)
> - TikTok
> - LinkedIn
> - Blog (Medium, website?)
> - Multiple channels (repurpose strategy?)

**Secondary Questions:**
> "Are you starting from scratch, or do you already have an idea to refine?"
> - **From scratch:** Claude generates ideas based on brand pillars and recent trends
> - **Refine existing:** Karim shares rough idea, Claude helps structure and optimize

**Context Questions (as needed):**
> "What's the goal?"
> - Brand awareness / Reach
> - Lead generation / DMs
> - Pipeline equity (providing value)
> - Selling a service/product
> - Testing a hook

> "Any specific topics, trends, or news angles you want to leverage?"
> - Recent AI tool launch
> - Client project to showcase
> - Industry trend to comment on
> - Open

### Step 3: Ideation & Collaboration
Claude generates ideas or refines Karim's concept:

- References `.claude/knowledge/core/OS_brand_messaging.md` for brand pillars
- Checks `.claude/data/news-sources.md` for timely angles
- Reviews `.claude/knowledge/writing-styles/[relevant].md` for voice
- Presents ideas with rationale
- Iterates based on feedback

### Step 4: Structure & Creation
Once direction is clear, Claude creates:

**Deliverables (based on channel):**
- **Ideas list** - Concepts with hooks and angles
- **Loose script** - Outline with key points and flow
- **Full script** - Complete word-for-word script
- **Instagram caption** - Hook + body + CTA
- **Carousel structure** - Slide-by-slide outline
- **Reel script** - Hook + B-roll notes + voiceover
- **Blog outline** - Headers and key points
- **YouTube description** - SEO-optimized with timestamps
- **Prompt for AI tools** - Midjourney, Runway, etc.

### Step 5: Iterate & Refine
- Karim gives feedback
- Claude adjusts tone, structure, or approach
- Repeat until it's ready to produce

## Idea Generation Framework

### When Starting From Scratch:

**1. Review Brand Pillars**
Which pillar does this content serve?
- Open-Source Design
- Client Transformation  
- Modern Craft meets Nostalgia

**2. Check Recent News**
What's timely and relevant?
- New tool launch to demo
- Industry trend to comment on
- Client win to showcase

**3. Consider Content Mix (80/20 Rule)**
- 80% = Core expertise (design, AI workflows, templates)
- 20% = Personal interests (making it relatable)

**4. Generate 3-5 Concepts**
Present multiple options with different angles:
- **Concept A:** [Topic + angle + why it works]
- **Concept B:** [Topic + angle + why it works]
- **Concept C:** [Topic + angle + why it works]

**5. Get Feedback & Refine**
Listen to which direction Karim prefers, then develop it further

## Example Workflows

### Example 1: Instagram Reel from Scratch

**Karim:** `/content-ideas`

**Claude:** "What channel are we creating for?"

**Karim:** "Instagram Reel"

**Claude:** "Got it! Instagram Reel. Are you starting from scratch or do you have an idea to refine?"

**Karim:** "From scratch. Something about AI tools."

**Claude:** "Perfect. I'll reference the Open-Source Design pillar since showing how tools work is core to your brand. Based on recent news in news-sources.md, I see Runway just released Gen-3 Alpha Turbo. How about:

**Option A:** 'I tested Runway's new Gen-3 Turbo for 24 hours - here's what it can actually do'
- **Why it works:** Timely, shows real results, positions you as early tester
- **Format:** Process video showing before/after with honest takes

**Option B:** 'Stop paying for stock footage - this AI tool is free and better'
- **Why it works:** Saves viewers money (high save rate), actionable
- **Format:** Quick comparison showing Runway vs. traditional stock

**Option C:** 'Framer just added AI components - I rebuilt my entire website in 2 hours'
- **Why it works:** Directly relevant to your MCP testing, shows speed
- **Format:** Time-lapse of rebuild with key learnings

Which direction feels right, or should I explore something else?"

**Karim:** "I like Option A but make it less 'I tested' and more 'Here's what's actually possible now'"

**Claude:** "Got it - less review-y, more demonstration. Let me draft a script for that..."

[Proceeds to create full reel script]

---

### Example 2: YouTube Video with Existing Idea

**Karim:** `/content-ideas`

**Claude:** "What channel are we creating for?"

**Karim:** "YouTube long-form. I want to do something about how we use AI in our design process but I'm not sure how to structure it."

**Claude:** "Great topic - plays perfectly into your Open-Source Design pillar. A few questions:

1. What's the goal? Pipeline equity (teaching) or selling a service?
2. How technical should it be? Show code/prompts or keep it high-level?
3. Any specific tools you want to feature? (Figma, Midjourney, Claude, etc.)
4. Target length?"

**Karim:** "Teaching, definitely. Medium technical - show some prompts but not overwhelming. Feature Claude, Midjourney, and Figma. Maybe 10-15 minutes."

**Claude:** "Perfect. Based on your long-form writing style guide, here's a structure:

**TITLE:** 'Our Entire Design Process - AI-Augmented (Real Client Project)'

**HOOK (0:00-0:20):**
'This is our actual design process for [Client Name]. No fluff, no theoretical - this is exactly how we use AI to deliver world-class design at a fraction of typical agency cost.'

**INTRO (0:20-1:00):**
- Who we are (quick)
- What you'll see (preview 3 main phases)
- Why it matters (designers can implement this today)

[continues with full structure...]

Does this direction work, or should we adjust the angle?"

[Iterates based on feedback]

---

### Example 3: Multi-Channel Repurpose Strategy

**Karim:** `/content-ideas`

**Claude:** "What channel are we creating for?"

**Karim:** "I want to create one piece of content and repurpose it across Instagram, YouTube Shorts, and TikTok."

**Claude:** "Smart! Let's design for the lowest common denominator (shorts/TikTok) and ensure it works everywhere. Are you starting from scratch or refining an idea?"

**Karim:** "From scratch. Something about design systems but make it not boring."

**Claude:** "Challenge accepted. Design systems CAN be boring, so let's find an unexpected angle. Based on your Modern Craft meets Nostalgia pillar, what about:

**Concept:** 'I rebuilt this 1990s website with a modern design system'

**Why it works:**
- Nostalgia hook (viral on all platforms)
- Shows design system value through transformation
- Before/after is inherently engaging
- Educational + entertaining

**Format (30-60 seconds):**
- Hook: Side-by-side 90s site vs. modern rebuild
- Setup: 'Design systems are boring... unless you do this'
- Process: Quick clips showing token setup, component build
- Reveal: Final modern site with 90s aesthetic influences
- Payoff: 'Same vibe, better system'

**Platform adaptations:**
- Instagram: More aesthetic focus, carousel showing steps
- TikTok: Faster cuts, trending sound overlay
- YouTube Shorts: Slightly longer, can include one extra tip

Want me to script this out, or explore other directions?"

[Continues collaboration]

---

## Learning & Calibration

### After Each Content Creation Session:

**Claude should note:**
- Which ideas Karim liked vs. rejected (patterns in taste)
- What angles resonated most
- Preferred script depth and detail
- Tone adjustments that worked
- Topics that energize vs. drain Karim

**Questions to ask periodically:**
- "How did that content perform? Should we do more like it?"
- "Was the script too detailed or not enough?"
- "Did the hook feel authentic to your voice?"
- "Should I adjust how I'm presenting ideas?"

### Goal Over Time:
- Fewer rejected ideas (better taste calibration)
- Scripts closer to final on first draft
- Faster ideation (Claude anticipates what will work)
- More trust in Claude's suggestions

---

## Tips for Karim

**To get the best results:**

1. **Be specific about the vibe** - "Make it more casual" or "This feels too hype-y"
2. **Share performance data** - "That Reel got 50K views" helps Claude learn what works
3. **Reference examples** - "Like this creator's style" gives Claude direction
4. **Give honest feedback** - "This doesn't feel like me" is valuable
5. **Iterate freely** - It's a dialogue, not a one-shot deal

**Don't worry about:**
- Asking for multiple rounds of revisions
- Changing direction mid-conversation
- Saying "actually, let's try something else"
- Being picky - this is your brand voice

---

## Future Enhancements

As this workflow matures, consider adding:

- **Content calendar integration** - Plan weeks ahead
- **Performance tracking** - What topics/formats work best
- **Hook library** - Tested openers that perform well
- **Template variations** - Proven structures for different goals
- **Trend monitoring** - Proactive suggestions based on news-sources.md
