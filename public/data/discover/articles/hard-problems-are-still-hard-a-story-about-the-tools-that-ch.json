          "content": "The essay \"Hard problems are still hard: A story about the tools that change and the work that doesn't\" by Peter Van Miller, published December 16, 2025, argues that agentic AI and generative tools accelerate prototyping and development but fail to resolve fundamental issues in design and product creation.It emphasizes enduring challenges like understanding user context, designing within constraints, and aligning technology with business value, even as platforms like V0 enable non-designers to build rapidly.This piece has gained traction in UX newsletters and robotics discussions, framing AI as a productivity booster that heightens rather than erases systemic difficulties.",
