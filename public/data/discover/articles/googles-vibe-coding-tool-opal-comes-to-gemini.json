Android-focused reports add that on the Gemini web interface, Opal’s capabilities appear under a Labs-branded “Build AI apps” banner in the Gems tab, even if the Opal name itself is downplayed for mainstream users. In practice, users see pre-built Gems—like learning coaches or coding partners—alongside their own creations, with Opal quietly powering any new mini-apps or “Super Gems” they set up. The same reports highlight that while the feature remains experimental and region-limited, it marks a clear step in Google’s pattern of migrating successful Labs experiments into the core Gemini experience.",

Industry write-ups describe this as Google’s answer to custom GPTs and other no-code AI builders, but with tighter ties to its own ecosystem of models and services. Security- and strategy-focused newsletters, meanwhile, stress that Opal’s mini-apps could quickly proliferate inside organizations, raising questions about governance, logging and standardization even as they promise major productivity gains.",

Analysts say this positions Gemini and Opal at the center of a larger shift, where AI models become the primary interface for both building and running software-like experiences. At the same time, they warn enterprises to treat Opal-built Gems as real applications—subject to review, monitoring and access controls—as vibe-coding moves from experiment to everyday practice.",
