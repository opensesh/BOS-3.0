## Content Ideas Format for Blog

### What Blog Article Ideas Should Be
**THOUGHT LEADERSHIP & PERSPECTIVE PIECES** - These connect to both short-form and long-form themes, but with editorial depth:

**Article Idea Examples:**
- "Our perspective: Why spec is the new code (and what that means for designers)"
- "The realistic AI toolkit for designers in 2025: What actually works"
- "Where we see design heading: Three trends that matter more than the hype"
- "MCP changed how we work: A detailed look at our new workflow"
- "Why most designers are using AI wrong (and how to fix it)"

### Article Types & Focus

**1. Future Perspectives (30%)**
- "Where is design heading?"
- Trend analysis with our take
- Long-term implications of current tools
- Provocative but grounded predictions

**2. Tool & Framework Analysis (30%)**
- "What's realistic for designers to adopt?"
- Honest reviews and assessments
- "Here's what we actually use daily"
- Tool comparisons with nuance

**3. Philosophy & Frameworks (25%)**
- "Spec is the new code" deep dive
- Design system philosophies explained
- Why certain approaches matter
- Connecting theory to practice

**4. Case Studies & Our Approach (15%)**
- How we solved specific challenges
- Client transformation stories
- Behind-the-scenes of our process
- Lessons learned from real projects

### Key Differentiators from Other Formats
- **Short-form**: Quick post idea → **Blog**: Why it matters (analysis)
- **Long-form**: How to do it (tutorial) → **Blog**: Should you do it? (perspective)
- **Both**: Tactical execution → **Blog**: Strategic thinking

## Platform Strategy

### Substack (2-5 min reads)
- **Purpose**: Real-time experiments, fresh discoveries
- **Style**: Quick updates, learning-in-public
- **Content**: "Just tried Claude 4.5 today, here's what happened"
- **Structure**: Hook → Quick experiment → Insight → CTA
- **Best for**: AI tools launches, design system experiments, workflow tests

### Medium (4-10 min reads)
- **Purpose**: Thought leadership, frameworks, industry analysis  
- **Style**: Authoritative but accessible
- **Content**: "How MCP Will Transform Design Systems (With Examples)"
- **Structure**: Problem → Framework → Case studies → Future implications → CTA
- **Optimize for**: Medium algorithm, claps, engagement

### Personal Blog (4-10 min reads)
- **Purpose**: SEO-optimized version of Medium content
- **Additions**: More keywords, internal links, meta descriptions
- **Note**: Content mirrors Medium but with SEO enhancements

## Writing Formula

### Opening
1. Start with a hook or problem statement
2. Follow with a story (personal experience, client problem, industry challenge)
3. Keep it relatable to designers feeling left behind by AI's pace

### Body Structure
- **Headings**: Clear, crisp, simple (use multiple subheadings)
- **Paragraphs**: 
  - Short for familiar concepts (ChatGPT, Figma)
  - Longer for new concepts (MCP, API architecture)
- **Technical Details**: Include to establish authority, but explain simply
- **Balance**: Mix inspiration (future vision) with instruction (how-to)

### Conclusion
Always include:
- Summary or key takeaways
- CTA to website/newsletter
- Optional: Questions for engagement

## Voice Guidelines

### DO:
- Write at high school reading level
- Make readers feel they're gaining an edge
- Share experiments and learnings openly
- Use "we" consistently (Karim & Morgan as team)
- Quote sources properly with hyperlinks
- Ask for images between sections
- Include code snippets when relevant
- Use emojis sparingly 😊
- Add humor naturally
- Include TL;DR for longer pieces

### DON'T:
- Get too technical for creative audience
- Use jargon without explanation
- Write in first person singular
- Overuse emojis
- Skip citations

## Content Themes

### Core Topics
- Design systems at scale
- Creative AI applications
- AI workflow automation
- Bridging design-development gap
- Making enterprise-level design accessible

### Unique Angles
- Enterprise experience (Google, SAP, Salesforce) applied to SMBs
- Design systems expertise meets AI innovation
- Visual artistry combined with technical prowess
- Making the complex feel approachable

### Pain Points We Address
- "AI is moving too fast, I feel left behind"
- "How do I stay relevant as a designer?"
- "What tools actually matter?"
- "How do I make sense of all this?"

## Style Inspiration
- **madebyjames**: Friendly, human nature
- **a16z speedrun**: Cutting-edge insights

## Technical Specifications

### Headlines
- Clear and simple
- Follow platform best practices
- Examples:
  - ✅ "How We Built a Design System in 3 Days with AI"
  - ❌ "Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for Rapid Design System Implementation"

### Formatting
- Use Oxford commas
- Hyperlink external sources or list as references
- Bold key insights sparingly
- Use markdown properly
- Include reading time estimates

### Cross-Posting
1. Ask: "Is this for one platform or multiple?"
2. Complete first platform version
3. Adapt for other platforms together

## Example Opening (Substack)

```
Yesterday, Anthropic dropped MCP. 

We immediately canceled our meetings and spent 6 hours building with it.

Here's what every designer needs to know: MCP isn't just another tool—it's the 
bridge between your Figma files and production code that we've been waiting for.
```

## Example Opening (Medium/Blog)

```
The Problem with Modern Design Systems

Last week, a creative director at a $10M startup told us something we hear 
constantly: "My team spends 60% of their time on updates, not innovation."

We've been there. At Google, we watched teams struggle with the same challenge. 
But here's what changed everything: treating design systems as living, 
AI-powered organisms rather than static libraries.
```

## Questions to Ask Before Writing

1. "Which platform is this for?"
2. "Should I include code examples?"
3. "Do you have a relevant client story or personal anecdote?"
4. "Want me to suggest image placement?"
5. "Is this based on a recent experiment or broader analysis?"
