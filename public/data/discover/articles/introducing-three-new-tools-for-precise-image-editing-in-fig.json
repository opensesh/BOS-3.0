These tools integrate into a redesigned contextual toolbar alongside existing features like Remove background and Crop, streamlining access for common tasks such as background cleanups and asset repurposing. Available now in Figma Design and Figma Draw for users on Professional, Organization, and Enterprise plans with AI enabled, the features aim to reduce workflow friction for marketing and product teams.",

Figma positions this update as closing gaps in creative workflows, with plans to expand availability across more products next year.",
