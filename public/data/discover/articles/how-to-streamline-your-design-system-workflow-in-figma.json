A 2024 study found that using Figma Variables alone can reduce design iteration time by around 30%, while Smart Selection slashes layer selection time by about 40%.These improvements are built on a complete rewrite of Figma’s design systems architecture, which now delivers 30–60% faster variable updates and near-instant state swaps in complex files.For design teams, this means smoother editing, faster feedback loops, and more time spent on creative work rather than maintenance.",
