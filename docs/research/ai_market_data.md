## How to Use This Data

### For Pitch Decks
- **Slide 1**: Show total market growth ($0.3B → $55B, 183x expansion)
- **Slide 2**: Show market composition shift (Foundation Models vs Application Layer)
- **Slide 3**: Application layer dominance by 2028 (51% of market, 72.4% CAGR)
- **Slide 4**: Your vertical positioning within application layer

### For Financial Projections
- Use 2028 application layer market size ($28B) as TAM ceiling
- Apply market share assumptions (5-10% = $1.4-2.8B addressable)
- Use Cursor/Lovable unit economics as comparable ($500-1,200 per customer annually)
- Project unit economics improvements as market matures and scale increases

### For Investor Conversations
- Benchmark against Cursor ($29B / $1B ARR = 29x revenue multiple)
- Benchmark against Lovable ($6.6B / $200M+ ARR = 33x revenue multiple)
- Reference that vertical AI apps achieve 5-8x higher pricing than horizontal tools
- Show that foundation model providers will go public 2026, validating category

### For Strategic Planning
- Application layer is where founders should focus (not building foundation models)
- Data moat (proprietary context) is sustainable defensibility
- Workflow embedding creates switching costs that protect against model commoditization
- Multi-model orchestration hedges against platform risk from model providers
