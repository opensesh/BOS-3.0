Configurable templates leverage component properties and variable modes, allowing users to expose editable elements like text, images, and colors while locking others for brand consistency. These updates build on Buzz's role as a dedicated space for producing marketing materials such as social graphics and event assets directly from Figma Design. Publishing templates is available on paid plans, with Professional teams limited to five and higher plans offering unlimited options.",
