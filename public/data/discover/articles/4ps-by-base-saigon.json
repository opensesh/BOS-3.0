Featured prominently in recent branding critiques, the project showcases innovative identities alongside works for global names like Momofuku and Hotel Park Ave, positioning Base Saigon as a key player in Vietnam's creative landscape. This effort emerges amid Vietnam's F&B boom, exemplified by Pizza 4P's expansion from a 2011 HCMC startup to a global brand with house-made cheese production scaling to 1,500-2,000 burrata balls daily.",
